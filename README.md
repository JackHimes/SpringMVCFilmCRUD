# SpringMVCFilmCRUD

## Overview
This is a paired-project that saw two individuals putting into practice the use of several technologies and design patterns to produce a minor Full-Stack project. Collaboration was conducted remotely over Zoom and Slack while managing work on the same files with the Github repository. Specifically the app is a pseudo-film database GUI that can be searched by either film id or keyword. Films are made up of various pieces of information that can be updated. Films can also be added to the database and those that the user creates can also be deleted.
<br>
To run, we used a local MAMP server for the database and a local Tomcat Server for testing, launching the application as a Spring Boot app from Spring Tool Suite.

## What We Could've Done Better
**JSP Management:**
<br>
Certainly the `.jsp`'s are not as succinct as they could or even should be. 
There are likely better ways of managing the repeated information between each of these files.
<br>
**Consistency**
